        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This vegan potato curry has abundant spices that make this better than any restaurant curry I've tasted.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, mined</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons curry powder</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons garam masala</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 (1 inch) fresh ginger root, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 (15 oz) garbanzo beans, peeled and drained</li>
            <li>1 (15 oz) canned peas, drained</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 oz) canned diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (14 oz) can coconut milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with curry powder, garam masala, cumin, salt, ginger, and cayenne pepper; cook and stir for 2 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Add cooked potatoes, garbanzo beans, peas, and tomatoes, then pour in coconut milk. Bring to a simmer and continue cooking for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>

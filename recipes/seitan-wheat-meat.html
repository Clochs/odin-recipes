        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This easy seitan recipe is the best I've ever used. I make it often to use on sandwiches and in stir-fries.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup vital wheat gluten</li>
            <li>4 1/2 cups vegetable broth, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup liquid amino</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup tamari</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir wheat gluten, 1/2 cup broth, liquid amino, nutritional yeast, oil, and garlic together in a bowl until ingredients come together into a ball. Knead until dough has a rubbery texture. Divide dough into 3 equal pieces and shape into 1/2-inch-thick patties.</li>
            <li>Combine remaining 4 cups vegetable broth, water, and tamari in a large pot; bring to a boil. Carefully lower patties into boiling broth; cover the pot and return to a boil. Set the lid slightly askew to vent steam and reduce the heat to low. Continue simmering, turning occasionally, until patties are firm, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and uncover the pot. Allow patties to cool in broth for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <p>This recipe makes roughly one pound of seitan. You can store the seitan with the broth in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Don't discard the broth â€” it makes a rich soup base!</p>
